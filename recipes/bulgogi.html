            Bulgogi is a popular Korean dish made from thinly sliced beef that is marinated and grilled.
            The marinade typically includes soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and onions, which give the beef a sweet and savory flavor. 
            The meat is often ribeye or sirloin, marinated for several hours to let the flavors soak in.
